## Principles & Readiness Metrics

- [ ] **Consistency**: same structure, tooling and commands locally and in CI.
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: pin NDK, CMake, Python deps, and model versions.
- [ ] **Observability**: JSONL logs, artifacts, build/device metadata.
- [ ] **Simplicity**: `ovbench all -c <yaml>` should work without manual steps.
- [ ] **Least privilege**: secrets and access are locked down to minimum.
- [ ] **Transparency**: docs cover end-to-end scenarios and incident SOPs.
- [ ] **Quality-by-default**: linters, formatters, typing, tests — mandatory and fast.
- [ ] **Readiness metrics**:
  - TTR (Time To Run) < 10 min for minimal run;
  - CI flake-rate < 2%;
  - Unit test coverage ≥ 70% for `core`;
  - Cross-device reproducibility: ≤ 5% median FPS delta.

## Fast Start: Top 10 Must-Haves

1. [ ] License chosen and added (MIT/Apache-2.0/etc.).
2. [ ] `pyproject.toml` + `ovbench` package with `ovbench.cli:app` entrypoint.
3. [ ] `pre-commit` with Black, Ruff, Mypy, end-of-file-fixer.
4. [ ] CI badges in README, working `bench.yml` workflow.
5. [ ] `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
6. [ ] Issue/PR templates, label set, PR gates (lint/tests).
7. [ ] Minimal `experiments/local.yaml` for “first run” out of the box.
8. [ ] Artifact/retention policy (S3/GCS/Actions artifacts) documented.
9. [ ] Secrets encrypted; onboarding steps for ADB/NDK/CMake in README.
10. [ ] Add “ARCHITECTURE.md” and this “CHECKLIST.md”.

## Strategic Choices (License, Versioning, Branding)

- [ ] License: MIT / Apache-2.0 / BSD-3 / Proprietary (document rationale).
- [ ] Versioning: SemVer (0.y for early releases) / CalVer (YYYY.MM).
- [ ] Branding: name, logo (if any), disclaimers (mention OpenVINO appropriately).
- [ ] External models policy: what can be in git vs artifacts/buckets.
- [ ] Privacy/PII: do not log user IDs or sensitive paths unless required.

## Repository Initialization

- [ ] `git init` or create on GitHub/GitLab.
- [ ] Set `main` as protected; forbid direct pushes; require PR reviews.
- [ ] **Branch protection**:
  - [ ] required checks (lint, type, tests, build);
  - [ ] required reviews (≥1/2);
  - [ ] no merge on red statuses.
- [ ] **Sign-off** (DCO) or GPG-signed commits policy.
- [ ] Enable **secret scanning** (GH Advanced Security/Trufflehog if available).
- [ ] Define **CODEOWNERS** for critical dirs (`ovbench/core`, `devices/*`, workflows).
- [ ] Add `SECURITY.md` (contacts, vulnerability disclosure policy).

## Directory Structure & Required Files

- [ ] `ovbench/` — sources
  - [ ] `cli.py` — Typer/Click CLI
  - [ ] `pipeline.py` — orchestrator
  - [ ] `config/` — schemas/loader/defaults
  - [ ] `core/` — shell/fs/artifacts/logging/errors/retry
  - [ ] `builders/` — openvino/benchmark
  - [ ] `packaging/` — packager
  - [ ] `devices/` — base/android/linux_ssh/ios_stub
  - [ ] `runners/` — benchmark runner
  - [ ] `parsers/` — benchmark_parser
  - [ ] `report/` — sink/summarize/render
- [ ] `experiments/` — YAML scenarios (at least `local.yaml`)
- [ ] `models/` — empty or `.gitkeep` (if models are not in git)
- [ ] `artifacts/` — git-ignored; generated at runtime
- [ ] `tests/` — pytest; at minimum: parser and device wrappers
- [ ] `.github/workflows/bench.yml` — CI pipeline
- [ ] `README.md` — quickstart, commands, requirements
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` — detailed design (1000+ lines)
- [ ] `CHECKLIST.md` — this file
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`
- [ ] `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `tox.ini`

## Python Package: pyproject, Dependencies, Extras

- [ ] Package via `pyproject.toml` (Poetry or PEP 621):
  - [ ] `name = "ovbench"`, `version`, `readme`, `scripts`.
  - [ ] Runtime deps: `typer`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `paramiko`, `pandas`, `rich`.
  - [ ] Dev deps: `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `mypy`, `ruff`, `black`.
  - [ ] Extras: `[dev]`, `[ssh]`, `[viz]` as needed.
- [ ] Minimum Python version: 3.11 (pinned in CI).
- [ ] Dependency pinning strategy: `^` / `~` / exact.
- [ ] Commands: `ovbench build|package|deploy|run|report|all`.
- [ ] `entry_points`: `ovbench = "ovbench.cli:app"`.

## Code Quality: Formatting, Linting, Typing, Hooks

- [ ] **Black** (formatting) and **Ruff** (linting) configured.
- [ ] **Mypy** (strict options for `ovbench/core`, `devices/*`).
- [ ] `pre-commit` with black, ruff, mypy, trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer.
- [ ] Quality badges in README (lint/type/test).
- [ ] Ruff profiles for excluding dirs (e.g., `artifacts/`).
- [ ] Fast unit tests (≤ 1 min locally) for core modules.

## External Tooling: NDK/SDK, CMake/Ninja, ADB, OMZ

- [ ] Android **NDK r26d+** installed (path documented in README and CI).
- [ ] **CMake ≥ 3.24** and **Ninja ≥ 1.11** installed.
- [ ] **ADB** available locally and on self-hosted runner.
- [ ] Optional: **OMZ** (Open Model Zoo) for model download/convert.
- [ ] Installation docs included for Linux/macOS/Windows.

## Secrets, Access, Environment Variables

- [ ] Document environment variables for CI (examples):
  - [ ] `ANDROID_NDK` (path on runner or secret/mount)
  - [ ] `SSH_KEY` / `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` (Linux ARM)
  - [ ] `S3_*` / `GCS_*` (if exporting artifacts)
- [ ] **Never** commit secrets in YAML/repo.
- [ ] Use GitHub Secrets/Environments; restrict scope to teams/branches.
- [ ] Secret updates through DevOps/Infra with audit logs.

## CI/CD: Pipelines, Artifacts, Gates, Caching

- [ ] `bench.yml` with two jobs:
  - [ ] **build-android**: build & package; upload artifact.
  - [ ] **run-on-device** (self-hosted): download artifact, deploy, run, report.
- [ ] PR gates: lint → type → unit → build → (opt) smoke run on device.
- [ ] Caching: pip/poetry and CMake/Ninja (actions/cache).
- [ ] Artifact retention: ≥ 7–30 days; name with `run_id` and `commit`.
- [ ] Publishing results: artifacts, S3/GCS, PR comments with FPS tables.
- [ ] Parallelism control: `concurrency.group` to avoid race conditions.

## Artifacts, Storage, Retention, Data Layout

- [ ] Artifacts:
  - [ ] `ovbundle_<platform>_<commit>.tar.gz`
  - [ ] `experiments/out/*.json` and `.csv`
  - [ ] JSONL stage logs and device metadata
  - [ ] (opt) SQLite DB with results
- [ ] Standardized record fields (timestamp, model, device, params, metrics).
- [ ] Retention and access defined (repo settings/S3 lifecycle).
- [ ] Local cleanup policy for `artifacts/` (`make clean`).

## Testing: Unit, Integration, System Runs

- [ ] Unit tests: metrics parser, command generation, device wrappers.
- [ ] Integration: bundle packaging (without real NDK), pipeline dry-run.
- [ ] System: minimal run nightly on a “test” device.
- [ ] Coverage: target ≥ 70%; report in CI.
- [ ] Pytest markers: `slow`, `device`, `ssh` — off by default.

## Device Farm: Inventory, Scheduling, Health

- [ ] Inventory (`devices.yaml`): serial → SoC/CPU/RAM/Android/tags.
- [ ] Scheduling by labels (e.g., armv8 + Android 12 only).
- [ ] Parallel across devices; serialize runs within a single device.
- [ ] Health checks: `adb devices`, `adb shell true`, auto-reconnect.
- [ ] SOP documented: replace device, update firmware, factory reset.

## Performance & Stability Methodology

- [ ] Fix **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** and ensure dependencies are co-packaged.
- [ ] **Cooldown** between runs; **warm-up** run (excluded from stats).
- [ ] Android stabilization: disable animations, screen off, airplane mode (if permitted).
- [ ] Governor/affinity only on allowed/rooted devices.
- [ ] Metrics: medians across repeats; keep raw log tail for diagnostics.

## Models & Data Licensing

- [ ] OMZ/open models — OK; proprietary models via artifacts/private buckets only.
- [ ] Record `sha256` and model version; consider excluding `.bin/.xml` from git.
- [ ] Respect model licenses; document in README/NOTICE.

## Security & Compliance

- [ ] `SECURITY.md`: how to report vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Secret scanning and dependency CVE tracking in place.
- [ ] Avoid PII in logs; redact sensitive paths.
- [ ] (Opt) SBOM for bundle; dependency license scanning.

## Documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, ARCH, CHECKLIST

- [ ] README: crisp, badges, requirements, commands, “first run”.
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md: full design & rationale.
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md: how to run tests/lint, PR process, branching.
- [ ] CHECKLIST.md: this preflight registry.
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md: manual or Conventional Commits + tooling.

## Releases & Versioning

- [ ] Choose scheme: SemVer/CalVer, pre-releases (`-alpha.1`).
- [ ] Tags and release notes (auto-generated from PRs/commits).
- [ ] Release artifacts: signed hashes, bundle archive, baseline results.
- [ ] Version support policy and EOL.

## Issue/PR Templates, CODEOWNERS, Labels & Workflow Policies

- [ ] `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.md` — bug/feature/perf/regression.
- [ ] `.github/pull_request_template.md` — what/why/how tested/screenshots.
- [ ] `CODEOWNERS` — by directories and critical files.
- [ ] Labels: `perf`, `infra`, `bug`, `good-first-issue`, `help-wanted`, etc.
- [ ] Branch policy: `main`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`.

## Rollback Plan & Incident Management

- [ ] Document release rollback (revert tags/releases, close artifacts).
- [ ] On-call/owners; SLA for CI outage or regression.
- [ ] Post-mortem template (what happened, root cause, action items).
